### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matthaios Letsios and in the past years I have been working in the field of Data Engineering and Data Science. List of my responsibilities in my previous roles have been to:

- Maintain, develop and enhance **airflow** pipelines focusing proper data collection, transformation and storage in the most efficient manner.
- Develop python services using technologies like **gRPC**, **postgreSQL**, **clickhouse**, **redis** and **kafka**.
- Develop and maintain **NLP** services.
- Developing different **machine learning** models (mainly anomaly detection).

### Research

In the past I have also worked as a researcher in Telecom ParisTech & Universite Pierre Marie Curie.

I'm also proud of being co-author to the following publications:

- Finding Heaviest k-Subgraphs and Events in Social Media. ICDM Workshops 2016 [link](https://oanabalalau.com/pdf/damnet2016.pdf)
- Scheduling under Uncertainty: A Query-based Approach. IJCAI 2018 [link](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0646.pdf)

### Fun Projects

**Understats Scraping**

<a href="https://github.com/leschiffres/understats-fpl"><img src="./img/fpl.png" width = "350" > </a>

<a href="https://understat.com">understat.com</a>  is a website providing advanced data for football matches e.g. xGoals, xAssists, xGChain etc. In this project I set up an <b>airflow instance</b> to collect the data for the Premier League football matches, transform them and then in the end visualize them in a jupyter notebook. The motivation behind this is the <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/">Fantasy Premier League game</a>, where I use those data as a basis for the weekly player selection.
			
**Book Recommender**

<a href="https://github.com/leschiffres/book-recommender"><img src="./img/book-recommender.png" width = "300"> </a>

This is an web app that makes use of <b>sentence embeddings</b> to be able to find appropriate books, based on the given desired description.
The webapp was build using <b>Fastapi</b>.

### Google Haschode

In the past I have participated in many google hashcode competitions. Unfortunately the competition no longer exists, but I hope Google will bring it back in the future. Here is the code for some of my participations.

**Google Hashcode 2021 - Qualification Round**

<a href="https://github.com/leschiffres/hashcode-2021-qualification-round" ><img src="./img/ghc-2021-qual.png" width = "350"> </a>

<b>Problem:</b> Given a city plan and all car itineraries in that city, the goal is to schedule all traffic lights, to help as many cars as possible to reach their destination on time. 

<b>Approach:</b> Our solution takes into account the in & out degree of each traffic light and assigns proportinally the time to each traffic light. Also we find out that assigning to all traffic lights 1 second of traffic time provided efficient solutions in some instances. This solution allowed us to reach top 20% of the leaderboard during the competition.
