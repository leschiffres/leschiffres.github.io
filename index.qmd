title: "Just another random Blog"

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is Matthaios Letsios and I was born and raised in Athens. Since I was a kid I enjoyed doing sports, playing board games and learning languages.

Unfortunately over the years I realised that I tend to forget many things. Sometimes I forget mathematics, programming or algorithmic topics.
Other times it's books that I've read or films that I've watched. This blog is a vain effort of me trying to document different stuff that I found interesting,
with the hope that in the future I can track them down more easily and hopefully some random person in the internet might find some usefulness in them.
